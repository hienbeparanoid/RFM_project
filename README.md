# RFM_project

This is created for IRM.
In this project, we have 2 Jupyter files, 5 csv files and 1 readme file.

## **Overview**

This RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) project involves the analysis of sales data to derive insights into customer behavior and segmentation. The project is organized into two Jupyter files, rfm_project.ipynb and merge_data.ipynb, each serving specific purposes in the data analysis processing. The project utilizes four CSV files: sales.csv, salesorder.csv, date.csv and customer.csv, and a merged CSV file structured_data.csv, each containing critical information for the analysis.

## **File Descriptions**
*rfm_project.ipynb*: This Jupyter notebook is the core of the RFM analysis. It involves the calculation of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer based on sales data. The notebook explores customer segmentation and derives actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

*merge_data.ipynb*: This Jupyter notebook focuses on merging and structuring the relevant datasets. It addresses data preprocessing tasks, handling missing values, and combining information from multiple CSV files to create a comprehensive dataset for subsequent analysis.

*sales.csv*: Contains detailed information about sales transactions, including customer key, order IDs, order date, ship date, product details, quantities,prices and other relevant details.

*salesorder.csv*: Provides information about sales orders, including channels and Sales Order Line Key.

*date.csv*: Includes details about dates relevant to the sales transactions, facilitating the calculation of recency metrics in the analysis.

*customer.csv*: Contains customer-specific information, including customer IDs, names, contact details, and other relevant details.

*structured_data.csv*: The structured dataset resulting from the merging process, incorporating data from various sources and prepared for the RFM analysis.


**Data Preparation**:

Run the merge_data.ipynb notebook to preprocess and merge the data, creating the structured dataset (structured_data.csv).

**RFM Analysis**:

Execute the rfm_project.ipynb notebook to perform the the results of this project. This notebook generates insights into customer segmentation and behavior, visualized charts and statistical analysis.

**Results**:

Review the generated visualizations and analysis results within the notebooks for a detailed understanding of the project outcomes without unexpected errors.
